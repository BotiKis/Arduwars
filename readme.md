### Gameplay
Arduwars is a port of [Advance Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_Wars) for the [Arduboy](https://arduboy.com/).
It is a turn based strategy game where the Players goal is to overtake the enemies Headquarters or destroy all his units.

Every turn, the Player commands his Units to capture Buildings or fight enemy Units. They key for winning is to use the enviroment strategically for your benefit. Certain terrain grant bonus for defense or movement. Buildings need to be captured to build more Units and get more income.

##### Battle system
Ever unit can be moved a certain distance. After a unit has been moved, it may attack or capture a building. Only infantry units can capture Buildings and not every unit can attack after it has moved.

Units that can attack, do so either directly (can attack adjacent to another unit where standing or moved, but be counter-attacked by the enemy unit), or in-directly (must remain still to attack, and have an enemy in firing range).

All unit traits are listed in the Units-section.
