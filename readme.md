#### Battle system
Ever unit can be moved a certain distance. After a unit has been moved, it may attack or capture a building. Only infantry units can capture Buildings and not every unit can attack after it has moved.

Units that can attack, do so either directly (can attack adjacent to another unit where standing or moved, but be counter-attacked by the enemy unit), or in-directly (must remain still to attack, and have an enemy in firing range).

All unit traits are listed in the Units-section.
