// In this file we store our maps.
// You can create your custom maps with tiled:The Map editor https://www.mapeditor.org/
//
// How to make custom maps:
// Open Tiled and create a new Tileset with the image in Assets/ called "worldSprite_16x16.png"
// The tile height and width should both be 16.
// After that you can create a new map and use the earlier created tilesheet
// to draw a map of your like.
// Next export your map as CSV.
// Open the CSV and add a colon ',' to the end of each line.
// Copy and paste the contents into an array below.
// Add the width and height as the first two values before the map data
//
// IMPORTANT NOTE:
// #1 Don't use the sprites 32 and 33 (Tops of the Headquarters) and place a plain (#14) there instead.
//    The game will automaticaly place the right tile for you.
// #2 Use a maximum of 24 Buildings. (Defined by BuildingType)
